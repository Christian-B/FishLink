Welcome to my addon for XLWrap

These instructions assume you are running git and know how to get stuff from there.

=========
This depends on the https://github.com/markbirbeck/xlwrap
So you will need to get that first.

Setup has only been tested in netbeans.

Create a project based on the markbirbeck code.
-make sure source code points to src directory
-make sure test code points to src-test directory
-make sure all jars in lib folder are included

build it

test by running at.jku.xlwarp.examples.ISWCEExample.java

documenation can be found at .../docs/website/index.html

If you get the server running in windows PLEASE let me know how you did it.
