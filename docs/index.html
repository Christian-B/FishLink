<h1 id=Introduction>Introduction</h1>
This document describes the tools created to help the capture of metadata and the generation of rdf.

<p>The purpose was to support the biologist who has some data to provide enough information(Meta Data) so that this data can be converted to rdf.

<p>The intention was to take data in a relatively free form, add some vocabulary restricted meta data and produce rdf datasets which adhere to a predefined ontology without forcing the data provider to learn the ontology or a mapping language.
The assumption was that the data provider would know the meaning of data. We also assume that the data provider will be comfortable with Excel but unwilling to learn a mapping language.

<h2 id="Why">Why Meta Data Capture is Required</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Metadata capture by Fish.NET was at dataset level.
	<li>Information about each column limited to one word header.
	<li>Data providers have few rules they have to stick to. Impossible for metadata values to be hard coded in.
	<ul>
		<li>There is no finite set of allowed column names.
		<li>Columns with identical names could mean different things/ different units/ different way of measuring
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="RDF">Enough RDF to understand these documents.</h2>
This section does not attempt to teach rdf but only to remind the reader.
<ul>
	<li>RDF is triples in the format
	<ul>
		<li>Subject  Predicate Object
	</ul>
	<li>Subjects are often URIs
	<li>Predicates typically come from a controlled vocabulary
	<li>Objects can be either URIs or constant values.
	<li>There will usually be several triples about a single subject
	<li>Subjects will typically have one or more type triple(s)
	<ul>
		<li>Subject  rdf:type  someType
		<li>rdf:type is the standard way of saying this subject is of this type.
	</ul>
	<li> There are several different rdf formats. Some of which may group the declarations about the same subject.
</ul>

<h2 id="Steps">Steps</h2>
This section lists the steps in the process of submitting data to producing rdf.

	<li><a href="#MetaDataCreator">Create Meta Data Capture Spreadsheet</a>
	<li><a href="#Annotate">Add the column level metadata</a>

	<li><a href="#sparql">Load rdf into a sparql server</a>
	<li><a href="#query">Query the sparql endpoint</a>
</ol>

<h1 id="ObtainData">Obtain the data</h1>
This step is actually a series of steps as explain in the workflow documentation.
The description here only adds extra information and limitation which directly effect the tools described here.

<ul>
	<li>The datasets will have to be uploaded to the FreshwaterLife website.
	<li>Each dataset will be assigned a PID by FBA
	<li>The tools described here only ever need read only access to this data
	<li>The raw data may be modify after the annotation sheet was created as long as
	<ul>
		<li>No columns are added or removed
		<li>The MetaData for each column recorded in the annotation sheet matches the current raw data
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="DataRestriction">Restrictions on the Data</h2>
The restriction listed here only apply to dataset over which the tools described here are run.

<ul>
	<li>Must be in a format that XLWrap can handle
	<ul>
		<li> Excel spreadsheet in either the *.xls or *.xlsx format
		<li> Open Office format (Unknown which versions XLWrap can handle)
		<li> CSV (Comma Separated File) format
		<ul>
			<li> Unknown if XLWrap can handle files with commas with quotes
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Sheet names will become part of the <a href="#Uri">URIs</a>. So it is suggested to make them meaningful.
	<li>Each row must be independent
	<ul>
		<li>Order should be irrelevant
		<ul>
			<li>Any order in the data must be explicitly supplied.
			<ul>
				<li> A time or date field
				<li> An "order" or "sequence" variable. (Not currently in the MetaMaster but easy to add)
			</ul>
			<li>XLWrap only considers the results of formulas, so formulas that relate to other rows are allowed.
			</ul>
			<li>Never taking data from a previous row
			<ul>
				<li>Either copy the data manually or use a formula to repeat it.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Each Columns must have the same meaning for every row.
		<li>Nulls are allowed.
		<ul>
			<li>Data is assumed to be unknown.
		</ul>
	<li id="MaxOneSite">Maximum of one type of
		<a href="#Location">Location</a>,
		<a href="#Site">Site</a>,
		<a href="#Enitity">Enitity</a>,
		<a href="#Survey">Species</a>
		and <a href="#Survey">Species</a> can be described per row in each table
	<ul>
		<li>Except for links such as
			<a href="#Owner">Owner</a>,
			<a href="#Contributor">Contributor</a>,
			<a href="#SiteField">Site</a>,
			<a href="#SurveyField">Survey</a>,
			<a href="#SubSite">isSubsiteOf</a>,
			<a href="#SimilarTo">isSimilarTo</a>
		<li>Only the id field of the second
	</ul>
	<li>There many be one of each on the same row but they must be related.
	<ul>
		<li>Ex. If there is a site and a location. That site is at that location
	</ul>
	<li>May have multiple Observations
	<ul>
		<li>Observation descriptions must be for 1 or all Observations
		<ul>
			<li>Example Remark applies to a single observation or to all.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Easting and Northings of different base and unit is an Open Issue!
	<ul>
		<li>Ideal is to not allow Easting and Northings but to force users to provide grid refs or Latitudes and Longitudes
		<li>Alternative is to insist all Eastings and Northings have the same base and unit
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="MetaDataCreator">Create metadata annotation sheets</h1>
This step creates and Excel Spreadsheet with extra header rows which will help the data uploader provide the required information required to produce rdf which complies to the ontology.
<h2> Tool </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Java program
	<li>Inputs
	<ul>
		<li>PID of the Raw data file
		<li>Indirect imputs
		<ul>
			<li>Raw data file in a format XLWrap can read (obtained from PID)
			<li><a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a> (Obtained via a PID currently hard code in program)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Output
	<ul>
		<li>Excel Spreadsheet <a href="#AnnotateSheet">Annotation Sheet</a>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="Annotate">Add the column level metadata</h1>
The <a href="#AnnotateSheet">Annotation Sheet</a> now has to be filled in by someone with Domain Knowledge.
All information provided here will be included in the final RDF output.

<h2 id="Information">Information Required</h2>
<h3 id="Category">Category</h3>
Type (or class) of the item being described.
<ul>
	<li>The category will be shown in the RDF using the rdf:type predicate.
	<li>This is required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "Category" row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception
		<li>If left blank the data in this column will not be included in the RDF
	</ul>	.
	<li>Category has a closed vocabulary. Additions required a significant change to the Ontology

<h2 id="Id">Id/Value Column (or "All")</h2>
A single table/sheet  can contain several <a href="#Observation">Observation</a>s.
This row allows the none <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> Columns to be assined to the correct <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> Column.

<ul>
	<li>The Id... value be used to create the rdf subject's uri. See <a href="#Uri">Creating Uri's Section</a>.
	<li>This is required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "Id..." row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception.
		<li>May only be left blank if <a href="#Category">Category</a> is not "<a href="#Observation">Observation</a>" or the <a href="#Field">Field</a> is "<a href="#ValueField">Value</a>". Otherwise <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception.
	</ul>	.
	<li>The legal values for "Id..." are:
	<ul>
		<li>"all"
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned the data in this column to every observation in the same row.
			<li>So for example if there is a Column with Categery "Observation", Field "Date" and "Id.." "all", this would assign the triple  ObservationX vocab:hasDate Y to all the Observations.
		</ul>
		<li>A String Column name of one, two (or with xlsx even three) characters.
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned the data in this column to the observation in the specified column in the <B>RAW</B> data.
			<li>So for example if there is a Column with Categery "Observation", Field "Date" and "Id.." "E", this would assign the triple  ObservationE... vocab:hasDate Y to the Observations whose <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> comes from column E.
		</ul>
		<li>Any other value will cause an Exception in the <a href="rdf">Generate rdf</a> stage.
	</ul>
	<li>ID... has a closed vocabulary. Currently it coveres the 255 values ("A" to "IV") in an *.xls Workbook, If needed could be extened up "ALH" for an *.xlsx Workbook.
</ul>

<h2 id="External">External Sheet</h2>

Used to convert value to a Uri
Could be a different sheet of same dataset
Sheetname
Could be a sheet in a different dataset
[doi]Sheetname
Currently no checking is done to see if external sheet exists.
Still a valid uri just doesn’t link to anything.
Used for Links such as isSimilarTo, Contibutor, Site
Used in a Link table
Which just links to external table together
Required for Many to many Relationships
Ex: Tarns Designations link

<ul>
	<li>This row is used for columns that contain a <a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Key</a>.
	<li>The External Sheet value (when provided) is used to create the rdf subject's uri. See <a href="#Uri">Creating Uri's Section</a>.
	<li>This is not required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "External Sheet" row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> assumes there are no.<a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Keys</a>
		<li>If left blank a local <a href="#Uri">Uri</a> will be created.
	</ul>	.
	<li>It could be a <a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Key</a> to another sheet in the same workbook, a sheeting in another workbook, or some external id system.
	<li>The legal values for "Id" are:
	<ul>
		<li>Another sheet in the same workbook
		<ul>
			<li>Just give the name of the other sheet.
		</ul>
		<li>A sheeting in another workbook
		<ul>
			<li>The other workbook will be refered to using its PID.
			<li>The format is [PID]sheetName
			<li>Assuming a workbook with PID "5e3de72b-a533-46fe-a319-97511f663245" and a sheet "People"
			<ul>
				<li>[5e3de72b-a533-46fe-a319-97511f663245]People
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>External id system
		<ul>
			<li>This is currently not supported but is a highly recommended extension.
			<li>Exact format will depend on the extenal Id Sytsem to be integrated.
		<ul>
		<li>Any other value may cause an Exception in the <a href="rdf">Generate rdf</a> stage, but are more likely to just generate rdf with strange links.
	</ul>
	<li>There is no need to included the column of the id in the external sheet.
	<ul>
		<li>Columns are not part if the generated <a href="#Uri">Uri</a>.
	</ul>
	<li>External Sheet does not have a vocabulary.
	<ul>
		<li>Therefor PIDs of both files already converted to RDF and ones still to be converted can be used.
		<li>Users are allowed any legal sheetName
		<li>The disadvantage of this open approach is there is NO error checking. An incorrect POI or Sheeet name will result in an apperently valid <a href="#Uri">Uri</a> but which does not link.
	</ul>

</ul>

May be a reference to another table or even dataset.
Would be used to create the rdf object uri
Are zero values to be considered Nulls?
Is a zero really zero or just “I don’t know”
This because Access to Excel inserts these zeros?

Could come from another column but rarely does.
