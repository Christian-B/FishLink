<h1 id=Introduction>Introduction</h1>
This document describes the tools created to help the capture of metadata and the generation of rdf.

<p>The purpose was to support the biologist who has some data to provide enough information(Meta Data) so that this data can be converted to rdf.

<p>The intention was to take data in a relatively free form, add some vocabulary restricted meta data and produce rdf datasets which adhere to a predefined ontology without forcing the data provider to learn the ontology or a mapping language.
The assumption was that the data provider would know the meaning of data. We also assume that the data provider will be comfortable with Excel but unwilling to learn a mapping language.

<h2 id="Why">Why Meta Data Capture is Required</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Metadata capture by Fish.NET was at dataset level.
	<li>Information about each column limited to one word header.
	<li>Data providers have few rules they have to stick to. Impossible for metadata values to be hard coded in.
	<ul>
		<li>There is no finite set of allowed column names.
		<li>Columns with identical names could mean different things/ different units/ different way of measuring
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="RDF">Enough RDF to understand these documents.</h2>
This section does not attempt to teach rdf but only to remind the reader.
<ul>
	<li>RDF is triples in the format
	<ul>
		<li>Subject  Predicate Object
	</ul>
	<li>Subjects are often URIs
	<li>Predicates typically come from a controlled vocabulary
	<li>Objects can be either URIs or constant values.
	<li>There will usually be several triples about a single subject
	<li>Subjects will typically have one or more type triple(s)
	<ul>
		<li>Subject  rdf:type  someType
		<li>rdf:type is the standard way of saying this subject is of this type.
	</ul>
	<li> There are several different rdf formats. Some of which may group the declarations about the same subject.
</ul>

<h2 id="Steps">Steps in RDF Creation Process</h2>
This section lists the steps in the process of submitting data to producing rdf.

<ol>
	<li><a href="#ObtainData">Obtain the data</a>
	<li><a href="#MetaDataCreator">Create Meta Data Capture Spreadsheet</a>
	<li><a href="#Annotate">Add the column level metadata</a>
	<li><a href="#Mapping">Generate XLwrap mapping file</a>
	<li><a href="#rdf">Generate rdf files</a>
	<li><a href="#sparql">Load rdf into a sparql server</a>
	<li><a href="#query">Query the sparql endpoint</a>
</ol>

<h1 id="ObtainData">Obtain the data</h1>
This step is actually a series of steps as explain in the workflow documentation.
The description here only adds extra information and limitation which directly effect the tools described here.

<ul>
	<li>The datasets will have to be uploaded to the FreshwaterLife web site.
	<li>Each dataset will be assigned a PID by FBA
	<li>The tools described here only ever need read only access to this data
	<li>The raw data should not be modify after the annotation workbook is created
	<ul>
		<li>The annotation workbook will become the latest version of the data
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="DataRestriction">Restrictions on the Data</h2>
The restriction listed here only apply to dataset over which the tools described here are run.

<ul>
	<li>Must be in a format that XLWrap can handle
	<ul>
		<li> Excel spreadsheet in either the *.xls or *.xlsx format
		<li> Open Office format (Unknown which versions XLWrap can handle)
		<li> CSV (Comma Separated File) format
		<ul>
			<li> Unknown if XLWrap can handle files with commas with quotes
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Sheet names will become part of the <a href="#Uri">URIs</a>. So it is suggested to make them meaningful.
	<li>Each row must be independent
	<ul>
		<li>Order should be irrelevant
		<ul>
			<li>Any order in the data must be explicitly supplied.
			<ul>
				<li> A time or date field
				<li> An "order" or "sequence" variable. (Not currently in the MetaMaster but easy to add)
			</ul>
			<li>XLWrap only considers the results of formulas, so formulas that relate to other rows are allowed.
			</ul>
			<li>Never taking data from a previous row
			<ul>
				<li>Either copy the data manually or use a formula to repeat it.
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Each Columns must have the same meaning for every row.
		<li>Nulls are allowed.
		<ul>
			<li>Data is assumed to be unknown.
		</ul>
	<li id="MaxOneSite">Maximum of one type of
		<a href="#Location">Location</a>,
		<a href="#Site">Site</a>,
		<a href="#Entity">Entity</a>,
		<a href="#Survey">Species</a>
		and <a href="#Survey">Species</a> can be described per row in each table
	<ul>
		<li>Except for links such as
			<a href="#OwnerField1">Site Owner</a>,
			<a href="#OwnerField2">Survey Owner</a>,
			<a href="#SurveyorField">Surveyor</a>,
			<a href="#UploaderField">Uploader</a>,
			<a href="#SiteField">Site</a>,
			<a href="#SurveyField">Survey</a>,
			<a href="#SubSiteField">isSubsiteOf</a>,
			<a href="#SimilarToField">isSimilarTo</a>
		<li>Only the id field of the second
	</ul>
	<li>There many be one of each type on the same row but they must be related.
	<ul>
		<li>Ex. If there is a site and a location. That site is at that location
	</ul>
	<li>May have multiple <a href="#Observation">Observations</a>.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#Observation">Observation's</a> descriptions (anything except <a href="#Value">Value</a>must apply to just 1 or all of the <a href="#Observation">Observations</a> in that row.
		<ul>
			<li>Example Remark applies to a single observation or to all.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Easting and Northings of different base and unit is an Open Issue!
	<ul>
		<li>Ideal is to not allow Easting and Northings but to force users to provide grid refs or Latitudes and Longitudes
		<li>Alternative is to insist all Eastings and Northings have the same base and unit
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="MetaDataCreator">Create metadata annotation sheets</h1>
This step creates and Excel Workbook with Spreadsheets that have extra header rows which will help the data uploader provide the required information required to produce rdf which complies to the ontology.
<p>This will probably be an automated step in the Fish.Link workflow.
<h2> Tool </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Java program
	<li>Inputs
	<ul>
		<li>URI Link to Raw data file in a format XLWrap can read
		<ul>
			<li>Could be a "http:\\"... link, but I am unsure if XLWrap can handle security
			<li>Files link's should start with "file:", and include the absolute path.
		</ul>
		<li>Indirect inputs
		<ul>
			<li>Raw data downloaded from the link
			<li><a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a> (Obtained via a PID currently hard code in program)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Output
	<ul>
		<li>Excel <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Instead of Raw data, a Workbook which already contains annotation rows may be used.
This will produce an updated Annotation workbook, with wherever possible the existing annotation copied across.
The new <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> will contain (only) the vocabulary from the <a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a>.
Any vocabulary added to the version input will be LOST.
Any annotation in the previous workbook will copied even if it does not match the vocabulary from the <a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a>.
<p>
<h1 id="Annotate">Add the column level metadata</h1>
The <a href="#AnnotateSheet">Annotation Sheets</a> now has to be filled in by someone with Domain Knowledge.
All information provided here will be included in the final RDF output.

<h2 id="Information">Information Required</h2>
<h3 id="Category">Category</h3>
Type (or class) of the item being described.
<ul>
	<li>The category will be shown in the RDF using the rdf:type predicate.
	<li>This is required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "Category" row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception
		<li>If left blank the data in this column will not be included in the RDF
	</ul>	.
	<li>Category has a closed vocabulary. Additions required a significant change to the Ontology

</table>

<h3 id="Id">Id/Value Column (or "All")</h3>
A single table/sheet  can contain several <a href="#Observation">Observation</a>s.
This row allows the none <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> Columns to be assigned to the correct <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> Column.

<ul>
	<li>The Id... value be used to create the rdf uri. See <a href="#Uri">Creating Uri's Section</a>.
	<li>This is required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "Id..." row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception.
		<li>May only be left blank if <a href="#Category">Category</a> is not "<a href="#Observation">Observation</a>" or the <a href="#Field">Field</a> is "<a href="#ValueField">Value</a>". Otherwise <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an Exception.
	</ul>	.
	<li>The legal values for "Id..." are:
	<ul>
		<li>"all"
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned the data in this column to every observation in the same row.
			<li>So for example if there is a Column with Category "Observation", Field "Date" and "Id.." "all", this would assign the triple  ObservationX vocab:hasDate Y to all the Observations.
		</ul>
		<li>A String Column name of one, two (or with xlsx even three) characters.
		<ul>
			<li>Assigned the data in this column to the observation in the specified column in the <B>RAW</B> data.
			<li>So for example if there is a Column with Category "Observation", Field "Date" and "Id.." "E", this would assign the triple  ObservationE... vocab:hasDate Y to the Observations whose <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> comes from column E.
		</ul>
		<li>"Automatic" or left blank
		<ul>
			If the Id... is not required the only option is "Automatic" which will have the same effect as leaving it blank.
		</ul>
		<li>Any other value will cause an Exception in the <a href="rdf">Generate rdf</a> stage.
	</ul>
	<li>ID... has a closed vocabulary. Currently it covers the 255 values ("A" to "IV") in an *.xls Workbook, If needed could be extended up "ALH" for an *.xlsx Workbook.
</ul>

<h3 id="External">External Sheet</h3>
Data in a table/sheet many refer to data found in either another sheet in the same workbook or even in data found in another workbook.

<ul>
	<li>This row is used for columns that contain a <a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Key</a>.
	<li>The External Sheet value (when provided) is used to create the rdf subject's uri. See <a href="#Uri">Creating Uri's Section</a>.
	<li>This is not required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "External Sheet" row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> assumes there are no.<a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Keys</a>
		<li>If left blank a local <a href="#Uri">Uri</a> will be created.
	</ul>
	<li>It could be a <a href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key">Foreign Key</a> to another sheet in the same workbook, a sheeting in another workbook, or some external id system.
	<li>The legal values for "Id" are:
	<ul>
		<li>Another sheet in the same workbook
		<ul>
			<li>Just give the name of the other sheet.
		</ul>
		<li>A sheeting in another workbook
		<ul>
			<li>The other workbook will be referred to using its PID.
			<li>The format is [PID]sheetName
			<li>Assuming a workbook with PID "5e3de72b-a533-46fe-a319-97511f663245" and a sheet "People"
			<ul>
				<li>[5e3de72b-a533-46fe-a319-97511f663245]People
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>External id system
		<ul>
			<li>This is currently not supported but is a highly recommended extension.
			<li>Exact format will depend on the external Id System to be integrated.
		</ul>
		<li>Any other value may cause an Exception in the <a href="rdf">Generate rdf</a> stage, but are more likely to just generate rdf with strange links.
	</ul>
	<li>There is no need to included the column of the id in the external sheet.
	<ul>
		<li>Columns are not part if the generated <a href="#Uri">Uri</a>.
	</ul>
	<li>External Sheet does not have a vocabulary.
	<ul>
		<li>Therefor PIDs of both files already converted to RDF and ones still to be converted can be used.
		<li>Users are allowed any legal sheetName
		<li>The disadvantage of this open approach is there is NO error checking. An incorrect PID or Sheet name will result in an apparently valid <a href="#Uri">Uri</a> but which does not link.
	</ul>
	<li>External Sheet would be required for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_table">Link (Junction) Table</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Both the values in this table would have External references.
		<li>The two items being linked will be in two different sheets.
		<li>For example:
		<ul>
			<li>One column could be Category <a href="#SiteFields">Site</a> Field <a href="#Id">ID</a> and External Sheet of the (possibly [PID] and) sheet where the Site is described.
			<li>The second column could be Category <a href="#Site">Site</a> Field <a href="#Designation">Designation</a> and External Sheet of the (possibly [PID] and) sheet where the <a href="#DesignationFields">Designation</a> is described.
			<li>As there is only every one <a href="#SiteFields">Site</a> and one <a href="#DesignationFields">Designation</a> per sheet (See <a href="#DataRestriction">Data Restriction Section</a>) The <a href="Id">ID ...</a> will be "Automatic".
			<li>The External Sheet values should point to the sheets where the <a href="#Id">ID</a> or the things referred to can be found.
		</ul>
		<li>RDF and this tool can handle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_%28data_model%29">Many to Many</a> relationships.
			In this case a single subject would have several triples with the same predicate but different Objects.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="ZeroNull">Zeros vs Nulls</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ideally zero should be used if there is a known value of zero or a known absence. Nothing here changes that.
	<li>Ideally null should be used if the value is unknown or not applicable. Nothing here changes that.
	<li>However some tools (such as Access) insert zeros whenever they export data with a null in a "numerical" column,
	<li>The tool therefor allow the user to state on a column basis is null
	<li>Other tools expect a null instead of a zero so users have to level zero values blank.
	<li>This option allows users to determine if zero and nulls should be treated as found or replaced.
	<li>This is set for each column.
	<li>This is not required.
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no "Zeros vs Nulls" row the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> assumes that all zeros mean zero and all nulls mean null.
		<li>If left blank "Keep as is" is assumed.
	</ul>
	<li>Legal Values are:
	<ul>
		<li>Keep as is: In which case a zero value is included and will result in an RDF triple X  Y 0, while a null value is excluded,
		<li>Zeros as Nulls: In which case both zero and nulls values are excluded.
		<li>Nulls as Zeros: In which case both null and zero value are included and will result in an RDF triple X Y 0
	</ul>
	<li>Cells with a none null one zero value are always included, irrespective of the value in this row.
	<li>This is a closed vocabulary. No other values make sense,
</ul>

<h3 id="Constants">Constants</h3>
The tool also allows for the addition of Constants that are applied to subject of every triple generated by the data.

These all behave in similar ways.
<ul>
	<li>The possible constant rows are defined by the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
	<li>Constants are not required.
	<ul>
		<li>If a constant row is not there the <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> assumes that it was not applicable.
		<li>If left blank it is assumed to be not applicable or not known for this row.
	</ul>
	<li>Declaring a constant has a similar effect to adding a new column with every value in that column being the same.
	<li>In the rare case where a whole column is about a single aspect not covered in the constants the easiest solution is to an extra column with every cell in that column being this value.
	<ul>
		<li>The alternative is to add an additional Constant header row to the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4 id="Factor">Factor</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Represent what is actually being measured.
	<ul>
		<li> For example Depth, Alkalinity, Dam, Nitrate
	</ul>
	<li>Only applicable if the <a href="#Category">Category</a> is "<a href="#Observation">Observation</a>" or the <a href="#Field">Field</a> is "<a href="#ValueField">Value</a>".
	<ul>
		<li> In all other case the value will be ignored. So the only allowed value is "n/a".
	</ul>
	<li>This is a semi open vocabulary
	<ul>
		<li>New terms can be added as needed.
		<li>The <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an error unless additions are included in the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
		<li>As of the writing this document the Factor vocabulary included many terms this author does not understand. They are all in ALL CAPS.
	</ul>
	<li>For <a href="#Observation">Observations</a> about <a href="#TaxonFields">Taxons</a> this field should specify what it says about the Taxon. For example "Abundance".
</ul>


<h4 id="Unit">Unit</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A number by itself is meaningless.
	<li>Represent what unit to go with a numerical value.
	<ul>
		<li> For example Feet, Meters, Ph, Litre
	</ul>
	<li>Could be a complex unit combining two individual units such as use Meqvl/1.
	<li>Could include a square of cube such as SquareMeters
	<li>"Count" is used if it is just the number of things.
	<li>Only applicable if the <a href="#Category">Category</a> is "<a href="#Observation">Observation</a>" or the <a href="#Field">Field</a> is "<a href="#ValueField">Value</a>".
	<ul>
		<li> In all other case the value will be ignored. So the only allowed value is "n/a".
	</ul>
	<li>This is a semi open vocabulary
	<ul>
		<li>New terms can be added as needed.
		<li>The <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an error unless additions are included in the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
		<li>Ideal this should be terms from an accepted vocabulary, but at time of writing this document no existing vocabulary had been chosen.
	</ul>
	<li>Keeping units out of the <a href="#ValueField">Value</a> allows for mathematical operations on the <a href="#ValueField">Value</a>.
</ul>


<h4 id="Deviation factor">Deviation factor</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Data could be "Raw Data". Based on a single value/ observation/ point.
	<li>Data could be a combination of several values/ observations/ points.
	<ul>
		<li>In these case this field says how they have been combined.
		<li>For example Mean, Max, Min, Difference.
		<li>Also applicable if only a single observation was ever made, but it was made in such a way as to be for example the "mean" or "max" value.
		<ul>
			<li>For Example the max depth of a tarn vs the mean depth of a tarn.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Only applicable if the <a href="#Category">Category</a> is "<a href="#Observation">Observation</a>" or the <a href="#Field">Field</a> is "<a href="#ValueField">Value</a>".
	<ul>
		<li> In all other case the value will be ignored. So the only allowed value is "n/a".
	</ul>
	<li>This is a semi open vocabulary
	<ul>
		<li>New terms can be added as needed.
		<li>The <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an error unless additions are included in the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
	</ul>
	<li>For Values that are derived from other values also in this (or another data set) we came up with the notion of a <a href="#DerivedFrom">Derived From Series</a>. But that is currently beyond the scope of this tool.
</ul>


<h4 id="SubType">SubType</h4>

<ul>
	<li>In some case the <a href="#Category">Category</a> is too broad a term, and all the items described in the table could actual be described in a more narrow way.
	<li>This cell allows such a narrower description to be applied.
	<li>Result in an additional rdf:type triple about each of the described items.
	<li>Only applicable for <a href="#Category">Categories</a> that have a list of subtype. At the time of writing this was
	<li><a href="#Location">Location</a>
	<ul>
		<li>Area

	<li>This is a semi open vocabulary
	<ul>
		<li>New subTypes can be added as needed both to <a href="#Category">Categories</a> that already have subTypes as well as the ones that do not yet have ones.
		<li>The <a href="#Mapping">Mapping stage</a> will throw an error unless additions are included in the <a href="#MetaMaster">Meta Master file</a>.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</h2>
The user will provide the <a href="#Information">Information Required</a>.
This will be provided by filling in an Excel workbook which contains not only the original data but also extra rows to add Column level metadata.

<ul>
	<li>Excel Spreadsheets) Annotation Sheet
	<ul>
		<li>One sheet for each sheet in the raw data.
		<li>Will have the same name as in the raw data
		<li>Extra header rows for collecting meta data.
		<ul>
			<li>One row for each <a href="#Information">Information Required</a>
		</ul>
		<li>The latest version of the raw data
	</ul>
	<li><b>Lists</b>Copy of the vocabulary from MetaMaster. "#Information">Information Required
</ul>

<h3>Filling in the Annotation Workbook</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Someone with domain knowledge of the particular dataset will have to fill this in
	<li>It is better to leave a non required cell blank rather than guess.
	<ul>
		<li>Leaving it blank shows the data user that this information is not known for sure.
		<li>Data users can then assume the standard value
		<li>For example better to leave an "Altitude" "Units" blank rather then just guess "meters". This show that there is a small chance it could be "yards".
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="Mapping">Generate XLwrap mapping file</h1>
This step creates an XLwrap mapping file which will be used to create the actual RDF.
<p>This will probably be an automated step in the Fish.Link workflow.

<h2> Tool </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Java program
	<li>Inputs
	<ul>
		<li>URI Link to <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> filled in.
		<ul>
			<li>Could be a "http:\\"... link, but I am unsure if XLWrap can handle security
			<li>Files link's should start with "file:", and include the absolute path.
		</ul>
		<li>PID: persistent identifier
		<li>Indirect inputs
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> downloaded from the link
			<li><a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a> (Obtained via a PID currently hard code in program)
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Output
	<ul>
		<li>XLWrap mapping file
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id:"MappingFile"> XlWrap mapping File</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This file should never need editing
	<li>Many of the annotation header values will be hard coded in here.
	<li>Valid as long as:
	<ul>
		<li>The URI link to the <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> remains valid
		<li>No annotation values (The header rows as described in <a href="#Information">Information Required</a>) are changed.
		<li>Note effected by changes to the <a href="#MetaMaster">MetaMaster Spreadsheet</a>. However generated results may no longer conform to the latest vocabulary.
	</ul>
	<li>Can be used repeatedly
	<ul>
		<li>As long as the <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> does not change will produce the same rdf each time
		<li>Changes to data cells will produce a different but still valid rdf file.
		<li>Changes to the header rows will be ignored values as these are now hard coded in the mapping file.
	</ul>
	<li>Depends on extra XLWrap functions provided with this tool.
</ul>

<h2 id="Uri">Generate URI values</h2>
One of the main tasks of the mapping files is to (indirectly via functions) is to generate the URIs used as the Subjects and of the Objects of the RDf triples.

<ul>
	<li>URIs will start with a prefix
	<ul>
		<li>This is hard coded in and is currently ""http://rdf.freshwaterlife.org/"
	</ul>
	<li>Then there is a keyword depending on the type of URI
	<ul>
		<li>type/
		<ul>
			<li>Use in the Object of rdf:type triples
			<li>Followed by a String value of the type
		</ul>
		<li>constant/
		<ul>
			<li>Use in with the <a href="Constants">Constants</a> where values come from a controlled vocabulary.

			<li>Followed by the String Constant
		</ul>
		<li>resource/"
		<ul>
			<li>Use in Subjects and Objects that depend on a Id, row or Cell location  (See below)
			<li>Followed by more information as shown below
		</ul>
		<li>vocab/
		<ul>
			<li>Used in the Predicates. (Unless they come from a known vocabulary such as rdf:type)
			<li>Followed by the String name of the Predicate
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>The <a href="Category">Category</a>
	<li>The PID of the document
	<li>The name of the sheet the data was found it
	<li>An identifier for this item
	<ul>
		<li>Id based
		<ul>
			<li>Used whenever available
			<li>Value found in the "Id" Cell will be used
			<li>If the "Id" cell is null no triples will be produced for this item
		</ul>
		<li>Cell based
		<ul>
			<li>Used for <a href="#Observation">Observation</a>
			<li>The Cell address of the <a href="#Observation">Observation's</a> <a href="#ValueField"">Value Field"</a>"
			<li>If that Cell is null no triples will be used.
		</ul>
		<li>Row based
		<ul>
			<li>Used for Categories other than <a href="#Observation">Observation</a> when there is no "Id" Column.
			<li>The row number the item was found in will be used.
		</ul>
		<li>For Columns other than the Id or Value column, both the cell in this column as well as the corresponding (in the same row) Cell in the Id or Value column must be none null. Otherwise no triple is generated.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="rdf">Generate rdf files</h1>
This step uses the <a href="MappingFile">XLwrap mapping file</a>to create the actual RDF.
<p>This will probably be an automated step in the Fish.Link workflow.

<h2> Tool </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Java program
	<li>Inputs
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="#MappingFile">XLwrap mapping file</a>.
		<li>Indirect inputs
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> downloaded from the link
			<ul>
				<li>Only the data rows of this file will be used here.
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Output
	<ul>
		<li>RDF File
	</ul>
</ul>

It is recommended that the <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> is not changed between creating the <a href="MappingFile">XLwrap mapping file</a> and the RDF file.

<h1 id="sparql">Load rdf into a sparql server</h1>
The next step is to load the rdf file(s) into a sparql server.
<p>This is expected to be an automated stage of the Fish.Link project.
<ul>
	<li>The exact steps are beyond the scope of this document as they are server implementation specific.
	<li>RDF files based on different PIDs can be combined into a single graph.
	<ul>
		<li> The <a href="#Uri">URIs</a> for each PID will be distinct from each other, except where specifically linked <a href="#External">External Sheet</a> reference so there will be no clashes.</h3>
	</ul>
	<li>Generally adding an new RDF files to an existing store will not remove or change previous values.
	<ul>
		<li>Exact duplicates are ignored.
		<li>However changes are considered new complementary information.
		<ul>
			<li>This results in both the old and new value being present.
			<li>For example say a value is corrected from 1000 to 10. The result would be 2 triples, X vocab:hasValue 1000 and X vocab:hasValue 10.
		</ul>
		<li>Additional information can be safely added. As long as the previous information is not removed, because many of the <a href="#Uri">URIs</a> depend on the row the data was found in.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1 id="query">Query the sparql endpoint</h1>
The sparql endpoint can now be queried, Either directly by a user or by some other application.

Again how to do this depends on the sparql endpoint used.

<h1 id="Admin">Administration Documents</h1>
<h2 id="MetaMaster">The MetaMaster.xlss</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Only available to Administrator
    <li>Used creating <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> which contain all the important information.
    <li>Used for checking when creating mapping files.
    <li>Single version to be used with all datasets
    <ul>
    	<li>It is technically possible to have various different MetaMaster workbooks,
    	<li>For example a simple vocabulary and an extended vocabulary.
    	<li>If an <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> is created with one master and checked when mapping against a different master this may cause errors.
    </ul>
    <li>"Lists" sheet
    <ul>
    	<li>This is the Master for the "Lists" sheet in the <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a>
        <li>This has three sections each divided by an empty columns.
        <li>Categories and Fields
        <ul>
            <li>Row 1:    Category
            <li>Rows 2+: Legal values for the fields
            <li>
        </ul>
        <li>SubTypes
        <ul>
            <li>Row 1:    Category +"SubType"
            <li>Rows 2+: Legal values for the SubTypes or "n/a"
            <li>
        </ul>
        <li>values for dropdown lists
        <ul>
        	<li>Factor: See <a href="#Factor">Factor Section</a>
        	<li>Unit: See <a href="#Unit">Unit Section</a>
        	<li>Deviation factor: See <a href="#Deviation factor">Deviation Factor Section</a>
        	<li>Automatic and NotApplicable: single valued groups used where applicable
        	<li>Column: "all" and then the legal column names. (xls based). Used by <a href="#Id">Id/Value Column (or "All")</a>.

        </ul>
        <li>Note:Order the values appear here (rows 2+) is the order they will appear in the dropdowns.
	</ul>
	<li>"DropDown" Sheet
	<ul>
		<li>This is the Master for the <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> Annotation Sheet(s)
		<li>Column A: Values to be copied to Column A of the Annotation Sheet(s)
		<li>Column B; Test dropdown/Data validation fields. Not used
		<li>Column C to H: Values to be used in the DataValidation. For the matching row in every column in the Annotation Sheet(s).
		<ul>
			<li>Values as if creating a "List" based data validation rule.
			<li>Column C: Value for the "Source" box in the "Settings" tab.
			<li>Column D: Value for the "Title" box in the "Input Message" tab.
			<li>Column E: Value for the "Input Message" box in the "Input Message" tab.
			<li>Column F: Value for the "Style" box in the "Error Alert" tab.
			<li>Column G: Value for the "Title" box in the "Error Alert" tab.
			<li>Column H: Value for the "Error Message" box in the "Error Alert" tab.
		</ul>
		<li>Rows below the Blank row: Control counts to make sure the lengths are not too long.
		<ul>
			<li>Poi does not check these and too long fields cause an corrupt Excel file to be generated,
			<li>Tool does throw an Exception.
			<li>Titles may only be 32 characters long.
			<li>Massages may only be 255 characters long.
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="ChangingMetaMaster">Changing the MetaMaster</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The MetaMaster is in no way a complete document,
	<ul>
		<li>Many of the vocabularies in the "List" Sheet need much additional work.
		<li>Many be a use to add an additional Constants row.
		<li>Text in Dropdowns could be improved.
	</ul>
	<li>Changes made will NOT effect already created metaSheets, mapping files or RDF.
	<li>Changes made before <a href="#Mapping">Generate XLwrap mapping file</a> will effect the checking done then.
	<li>Adding to the MetaMaster will never effect the checking of valid <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> Annotation Sheet(s)
	<li>Changing the MetaMaster will only effect the checking of valid <a href="#AnnotationWorkbook">Annotation Workbook</a> Annotation Sheet(s) if the Sheet uses a value no longer in the MetaMaster.
</ul>
<h1 id="FutureWork">Future Work</h1>
There is always a lot more work that can be done.
<ul>
	<li>Vocabularies need completing.
	<li>Easting and Northings allowing different units and bases needs sorting.
</ul>
<h2 id="DerivedFrom">Derived From Series</h2>
There are times when a data set contains both raw data and some form of derived data. For example
<ul>
	<li>Data measured in one Unit and the converted to a second Unit
	<ul>
		<li>For Example inches converted to Centimetres but both values included.
	</ul>
	<li>Individual Values
	<ul>
		<li>For Example Daily values and then weekly values.
	</ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolated">Interpolated data</a>
	<ul>
		<li>For Example Rainfall not recorded Sunday morning. Mondays recording is assumed to be half on Saturday, half on Sunday.
	</ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio">Ratio data</a>
	<ul>
		<li>For Example: Percentage of Visitors who are Female based on both Male and Female Visitor numbers
		<li>For Example Plants per Square meters, based on total number of plants and area.
	</ul>
</ul>
The steps to capture this information would be.
<ul>
	<li>For each Derived value: create a Observation Series Object.
	<ul>
		<li>Two values are based on exactly the same Observation (for example weekly Sum and Average) could share the same series.
	</ul>
	<li>Add the Specific Observations to the Series
	<ul>
		<li>Subject is URI of the Series
		<li>Predicate suggestion is vocab:hasObservation
		<li>Object is the URI of the raw Observation being added
	</ul>
	.
	<li>Add a triple to the Derived Observation
	<ul>
		<li>Subject is URI of the Derived Observation
		<li>Predicate suggestion is vocab:DervidedFrom
		<li>Object is the URI of the Series create above
	</ul>
</ul>
Suggested to do this even when Observations are derived from a single Observation. This keeps things consistent.
