The code here depends on Xlwrap.

It mainly depends on Mark Birkeck version available at:
https://github.com/markbirbeck/xlwrap.git

I have since added in Apache POI which allows it to read xlsx files (Excel 2007+)

The long term hope is that this will be pulled into the above project.

In the short term my stuff is available at:
https://Christian-B@github.com/Christian-B/xlwrap.git
or
git@github.com:Christian-B/xlwrap.git

You only need to download on of these two as my version is forked of mark's and will include all his stuff.
